Group project creating travel_space web app by Josh Kim, James Pike, Shih-Hung Chang

#### travel space
- Travel space provides a platform for users to look up the crowdedness of the skytrain they want to take, and report 
the crowdedness of the skytrain they are taking. By doing so, we encourage the use of public transportation, reduce the 
number of cars on the road, improve commute times, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
